Program to calculate structural properties of amorphous silicon
The program reads a configuration of amorphous silicon model as 
a single XYZ file and calculates Rair-Correlation Function (PCF)
Structure Factor (S(k)), Bond-Angle Distribution (BAD), and   
generate Coordination Number (CN) and Nearest Neighor Map (NMAP)
